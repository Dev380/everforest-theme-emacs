;; Version: 1.26.0

;; Package-Requires: ((autothemer "0.2"))

;;; Commentary:

;; Using autothemer since 1.00

;; A port of the Everforest colorscheme for Vim, built on top of the new built-in
;; theme support in Emacs 24.
;;
;; This theme contains my own modifications and it's a bit opinionated
;; sometimes, deviating from the original because of it. I try to stay
;; true to the original as much as possible, however. I only make
;; changes where I would have made the changes on the original.
;;
;; Since there is no direct equivalent in syntax highlighting from Vim to Emacs
;; some stuff may look different, especially in stuff like JS2-mode, where it
;; adds stuff that Vim doesn't have, in terms of syntax.

;;; Credits:

;; Pavel Pertsev created the original theme for Vim, on which this port
;; is based.

;; Lee Machin created the first port of the original theme, which
;; Greduan developed further adding support for several major modes.
;;
;; Jason Milkins (ocodo) has maintained the theme since 2015 and is
;; working with the community to add further mode support and align
;; the project more closely with Vim Everforest.
